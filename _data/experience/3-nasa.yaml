  I wrote my Master Thesis at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in the US, Maryland. The thesis focused on space weather visualization. I integrated the science tool <a href="http://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">iSWA</a> into a project called <a href="http://openspace.itn.liu.se/" target="_blank">OpenSpace</a>. The video shows the effect of the St. Patric's day solar storm of 2015 on the global magnetosphere pressure, visualized in OpenSpace.
